# Darken - Screen Dimmer
A macOS app that covers the entire screen with a dark transparent overlay, similar to the "Low Light" accessibility filter on iOS.

## Usage
After running the app, click the crescent moon in the status bar to get a slider to adjust the darkness level:

It is recommended to turn down the screen brightness completely first.

If you prefer a specific color overlay instead, you can use the Accessibiliy settings within macOS. For some reason, these filters are not able to do darker colors (unlike on iOS), which is where this app comes in.
